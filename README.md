Chicago Python's Community Engagement Slack bot.

## Introduction

With over four thousand members, the [Chicago Python Users Group](https://www.chipy.org/) (ChiPy) is one of the largest Python communities in the world. Slack has become the primary method of communication amongst our members in-between events. We developed an open-source Slack bot, codename: Busy Beaver, to increase community engagement.

We released Busy-Beaver on January 10th at the ChiPy monthly meeting. [Slides](http://bit.ly/busy-beaver) and [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBESR_x7Kc) from the release announcement are available online.

## Features

### GitHub Activity

Busy-Beaver posts daily summaries of public GitHub activity for registered users in the `#busy-beaver` channel on the [ChiPy Slack](https://chipy.slack.com/). The goal of this feature is to increase engagement by sparking conversations around GitHub activity.

Users sign up for an account by `DM`ing the bot with the phrase: `connect`. The bot requires users to sign into GitHub to ensure only authorized activity is posted in the channel.

### Retweeter

Busy-Beaver retweets posts made to the [@ChicagoPython Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ChicagoPython) in the `#at-chicagopython` channel on the [ChiPy Slack](https://chipy.slack.com/).

## Roadmap

We are currently working on additional features to improve ChiPy community engagement. Please join the conversation in `#busy-beaver-meta` on the [ChiPy Slack](https://chipy.slack.com/).

## Development Notes

Busy-Beaver is an open source project where all artificats (code, Docker image, etc) are online. We use the [Twelve-Factor Application Methodology](https://12factor.net) for building services to design the CICD process and to keep information secure.

### Web Application Stack

- [traefik](https://traefik.io) - reverse proxy and load balancer
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- [flask-sqlalchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/)
- [flask-migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests)

### Tests

- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)
- [vcr.py](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy)
- [pytest-vcr](https://github.com/ktosiek/pytest-vcr)
- [pytest-freezegun](https://github.com/ktosiek/pytest-freezegun)

`vcr.py` records cassettes of requests and responses for new tests, and replays them for previously written tests. Make sure to [filter credentials](https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#filter-information-from-http-headers)

### DevOps

- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is how we deploy to production
- [watchtower](https://github.com/v2tec/watchtower) (monitors DockerHub, downloads and deploys latest image)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)

### Services

We are grateful to the following organizations for providing free services to open source projects:

- [GitHub](https://github.com) (code repo, issues)
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) (hosting Docker images)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) (continuous integration platform)

### Installation Notes

Create a Slack app via the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/). The app will need **Event Subscriptions** configured to send information to a server for processing. Specifically, the Slack app is subscribed to [message.im](https://api.slack.com/events/message.im) bot events, which include direct messages sent to the bot. The app will also need scopes configured in **OAuth & Permissions** (see [here](#Slack-Permission-Scopes)).

Configure a server with an endpoint URL to receive HTTP POST requests when `message.im` events occur. A service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is useful here for local development purposes.

Create a GitHub app. The sole function of this app is to provide a means for the Slack user to validate their GitHub account.

When a Slack user chats "connect" to the bot user via direct message, the server receives the event details and generates a unique `state` identifier. The server logs the Slack user and identifier to our server database. The bot user chats a GitHub URL containing our GitHub app's `client_id` and the `state` identifier. The URL leads the user to a validation page in which they log in to GitHub and approve access to basic public information. Upon approval, the GitHub user's details and `state` identifier are sent to another server endpoint. The server updates the Slack user record with GitHub user details by using the `state` identifier as a common key.

### API Docs

Can make requests to REST endpoints to kick off processes. Currently we are using CRON to run repetitive tasks; [this is managed by Ansible](https://github.com/alysivji/busy-beaver/blob/master/ansible/roles/cron/tasks/main.yml) to avoid manual configuration.

#### GitHub Summary Endpoint

- Start the process to run a summary by making a `POST` request to `/poll-twitter` with `Authentication` header set to `token {token}` and JSON body:

```json
{
  "channel": "busy-beaver"
}
```

#### Retweeter Endpoint

- Check Twitter feed for new posts to share on Slack by making a `POST` request to `/github-summary` with `Authentication` header set to `token {token}` and JSON body:

```json
{
  "channel": "at-chicagopython"
}
```

#### Creating API Account and Token

```python
admin = ApiUser(username="admin", token="abc123!")
db.session.add(admin)
db.session.commit()
```

## Development Environment

```console
export POSTGRES_USER=[username]
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=[password]
export DATABASE_URI=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@db:5432/busy-beaver

export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=[client-id]
export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=[client-secret]
export GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=[token-here]

export SLACK_BOTUSER_OAUTH_TOKEN=[token-here]

export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=[token-here]
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=[token-here]
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=[token-here]
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=[token-here]
```

Leverage Docker-Compose to create a containerized local development environment. Please see the `Makefile` for available commands.

### [pdb++](https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp/) Configuration

PDB++ improves the debugging experience inside the shell.

```python
# ./.pdbrc.py

import pdb


class Config(pdb.DefaultConfig):
    sticky_by_default = True  # start in sticky mode
    current_line_color = 40  # black
```

### [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

Pre-commit is a tool used to enforce linting with `flake8` and code formatting with `black`. To get started using
pre-commit, `pip install pre-commit==1.14.4` (this is in the `requirements.txt` file). Then run `pre-commit install`
to install the `flake8` and `black` environments locally.

Pre-commit will run on files staged for change automatically. You can also check pre-commit hook compliance on staged
files by running `pre-commit run` at any time. Note that pre-commit ignores files that are not staged for change.
