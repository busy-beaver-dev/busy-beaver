Chicago Python's Community Engagement Slack bot.

## Introduction

With over four thousand members, the [Chicago Python Users Group](https://www.chipy.org/) (ChiPy) is one of the largest Python communities in the world. Slack has become the primary method of communication amongst our members in-between events. We developed an open-source Slack bot, codename: Busy Beaver, to increase community engagement.

We released Busy Beaver on January 10th at the ChiPy monthly meeting. [Slides](http://bit.ly/busy-beaver) and [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBESR_x7Kc) from the release announcement are available online.

## Features

### Upcoming Events

Busy Beaver integrates with Meetup API to provide details about upcoming events. The interface for users is provided the `/busybeaver` [slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands).

- `/busybeaver next` shows details of the upcoming event

### GitHub Activity

Busy Beaver posts daily summaries of public GitHub activity for registered users in the `#busy-beaver` channel on the [ChiPy Slack](https://chipy.slack.com/). The goal of this feature is to increase engagement by sparking conversations around GitHub activity.

Users sign up for an account by `DM`ing the bot with the phrase: `connect`. The bot requires users to sign into GitHub to ensure only authorized activity is posted in the channel.

### Retweeter

Busy Beaver retweets posts made to the [@ChicagoPython Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ChicagoPython) in the `#at-chicagopython` channel on the [ChiPy Slack](https://chipy.slack.com/).

## Roadmap

We are currently working on additional features to improve ChiPy community engagement. Please join the conversation in `#busy-beaver-meta` on the [ChiPy Slack](https://chipy.slack.com/).

## Contributing

Busy Beaver is always looking for new contributors! Previous open source experience is not required! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development Notes

Busy Beaver is an open source project where all artificats (code, Docker image, etc) are online. We use the [Twelve-Factor Application Methodology](https://12factor.net) for building services to design the CICD process and to keep information secure.

### Web Application Stack

- [traefik](https://traefik.io) - reverse proxy and load balancer
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- [flask-sqlalchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/)
- [flask-migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests)

### Tests

- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)
- [vcr.py](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy)
- [pytest-vcr](https://github.com/ktosiek/pytest-vcr)
- [pytest-freezegun](https://github.com/ktosiek/pytest-freezegun)

`vcr.py` records cassettes of requests and responses for new tests, and replays them for previously written tests. Make sure to [filter credentials](https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#filter-information-from-http-headers)

### DevOps

- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is how we deploy to production
- [watchtower](https://github.com/v2tec/watchtower) (monitors DockerHub, downloads and deploys latest image)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)

### Services

We are grateful to the following organizations for providing free services to open source projects:

- [GitHub](https://github.com) (code repo, issues)
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) (hosting Docker images)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) (continuous integration platform)

### API Docs

Can make requests to REST endpoints to kick off processes. Currently we are using CRON to run repetitive tasks; [this is managed by Ansible](https://github.com/alysivji/busy-beaver/blob/master/ansible/roles/cron/tasks/main.yml) to avoid manual configuration.

#### GitHub Summary Endpoint

- Start the process to run a summary by making a `POST` request to `/poll-twitter` with `Authentication` header set to `token {token}` and JSON body:

```json
{
  "channel": "busy-beaver"
}
```

#### Retweeter Endpoint

- Check Twitter feed for new posts to share on Slack by making a `POST` request to `/github-summary` with `Authentication` header set to `token {token}` and JSON body:

```json
{
  "channel": "at-chicagopython"
}
```

#### Creating API Account and Token

```python
admin = ApiUser(username="admin", token="abc123!")
db.session.add(admin)
db.session.commit()
```
